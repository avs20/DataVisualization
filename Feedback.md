	Hi @t0mkaka,

	You chose an interesting way to encode the all this information. This way I can easily see what social class and gender most survived. On another side, I'm not sure about the age. Maybe if you include some filters will make it clear. Also, as a suggestion, you could create a dashboard with other charts summarizing the information filtered.

	It's a bit hard to differentiate the ages, possible to use distribution histogram for them perhaps?﻿

	In my opinion, age is not readable... Another thing, have you considered to take into account the PARCH or SIBSP variables?﻿

	I think that you could use one axis for the continues feature (age) that will be more clear than the size. That will also allow you to use a chart type that will reduce the overplotting ( box plot?, lil histograms ) .
