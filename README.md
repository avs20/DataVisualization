### Data Visualization Process

### Dataset 
The dataset I am exploring is Titanic passenger data. The dataset 
is downloaded from Kaggle and contains information regarding passenger details
such as class, age, survived/notsurvived,etc.

### Introduction to Visualization

My visualization is about survival on Titanic with respect to age and class of 
ticket. The default view shows percentage of passenger survived for any particular
age. This is encoded by color with black showing 0-20% and green showing 80-100% 
of passengers surviving. The user can also interact with the dropdown menu to select
a gender which will update the plot for males/females. 

In the end we find that if a passenger is of lower age or first class then he/she has
higher chances of survival. Also the chances of survival increse if the passenger is
female.
